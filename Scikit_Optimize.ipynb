        "\n",
        "* Log-uniform distribution: This means the values are spread out more on a logarithmic scale. Smaller values are more likely to be chosen than larger ones. For example, for a learning rate, values like 0.001 might be chosen more often than 0.1 because it focuses more on the smaller numbers.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), we commonly use log-uniform distributions for tuning the learning rate. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning rates often span multiple orders of magnitude (e.g., 0.0001 to 0.1), and using a log-uniform distribution ensures that smaller values, which are typically more effective for fine-tuning, are explored more thoroughly.\n",
        "Since small changes in the learning rate can have a big impact on training, log-uniform allows us to sample more from smaller values, which often leads to better results.\n",
        "In contrast, a uniform distribution would treat all values equally, making it less likely to find those smaller, more effective learning rates. This is why log-uniform is preferred for learning rate in ANN tuning."
